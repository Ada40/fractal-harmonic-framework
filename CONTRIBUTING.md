Contributing to Recursive Fractal Harmonics

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Ada40/fractal-harmonic-framework!

Why a CLA?
To allow the project to remain free for educational and research use while offering paid commercial licenses,
we ask contributors to sign a simple Contributor License Agreement (CLA). The CLA permits the project maintainer
(Adam Lee Hatchett) to re-license contributions for commercial licensing while preserving contributor credit.

How to contribute
1. Fork the repository and make your changes on a feature branch.
2. Open a Pull Request with a clear description and test instructions.
3. Add the line `I accept the CLA` to your PR description (this is required to merge).

Getting the CLA
- The CLA text is in CLA.txt at the repo root. To sign:
  - Print, sign, and email a scanned copy to adamleehatchett@yahoo.com, or
  - Provide a digital signature via DocuSign/HelloSign; contact adamleehatchett@yahoo.com for details.

Code standards
- Add tests where applicable.
- Follow the existing code style in Python files (PEP8).
- Document new public functions and include examples.

If you prefer not to sign the CLA, you can still:
- File issues, suggest changes, or provide non-code contributions (docs, examples) via pull requests.
