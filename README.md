## Executive Summary
The Fractal Harmonic Framework is a rigorous mathematical model demonstrating that stable, self-organizing systems operate through nested triadic harmonic ratios across all physical scales. By defining system stability through discrete frequency relationships (f1:f2:f3 = n1:n2:n3), this framework provides a non-divergent alternative to classical point-singularity models in physics and unstable latent space representations in artificial intelligence.

## The Fundamental Law: Triadic Resonance
Discovered by Adam Lee Hatchett (2024), the Universal Harmonic Law states:

```
f1 : f2 : f3 = n1 : n2 : n3
```

**Where:**
- **f:** Fundamental frequency or periodic cycle (Hz, s^-1)
- **n:** Discrete mode index or quantum number (integer)

This equation governs the stability of coupled oscillators from quantum electrodynamics to orbital mechanics.

## Enterprise Implementation: MyMirror AI
The MyMirror AI Platform serves as the primary commercial implementation of this framework, weaponizing the Golden Ratio (phi approx 1.618) as a biological security mechanism.

### Key Integration Points:
- **Temporal Control Plane:** Uses Fibonacci-aligned lifecycles (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21) to maintain system equilibrium.
- **Triadic Memory Sharding:** Distributes data across three temporal slices (Hot, Warm, Cold) with TTLs weighted by phi, mirroring triadic mode coupling.
- **Self-Similar Audit Trails:** Employs fractal pattern recognition for visually evident intrusion detection.

## Publications and Academic Evidence

### [Triadic Resonance Families in Multi-Planet Systems: Evidence from Kepler and TESS Data (2026)](./paper/Hatchett_2026_TriadicResonance.md)
**Author:** Adam L. Hatchett  
**Abstract:** Statistical analysis of 112 multi-planet systems reveals clustering of orbital period ratios around three families: harmonic (1:2:3), Pythagorean (3:4:5), and golden (1:φ:φ²). These configurations occur with 4.8σ significance over random distributions, suggesting phase-space evolution toward stability attractors.

## Mathematical Foundations
The framework is supported by a complete set of coupling equations and wave functions:
- Energy Quantization: E = hf
- Phase Coherence: C = 1 - |delta_phi_12 + delta_phi_23 + delta_phi_31| / (6*pi)
- Dynamic Coupling: dAi/dt = -gamma_i * Ai + sum(alpha_ij * Aj)
