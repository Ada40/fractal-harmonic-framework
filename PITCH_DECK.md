# SLIDE 1: THE PROBLEM

## Physics is Fragmented Across Scales

**Current state:**
- Quantum mechanics (atoms)
- Neuroscience (brains)
- Celestial mechanics (planets)
- Cosmology (galaxies)

**All use DIFFERENT mathematical frameworks.**

**No unified theory connects them.**

### The Cost:
- Climate models miss cross-scale interactions
- AI lacks biological principles
- Drug discovery ignores harmonic resonance
- Space missions can't predict orbital stability

**We need a universal law that works from atoms to galaxies.**

# SLIDE 2: THE SOLUTION

## One Law, All Scales

### The Fractal Harmonic Code:

```
f₁ : f₂ : f₃ = n₁ : n₂ : n₃
```

**Frequency ratios equal quantum number ratios.**

**This single equation governs:**
- Electron orbitals (quantum)
- Brain waves (neural)
- Planetary resonances (orbital)
- Galaxy clustering (cosmological)

### Key Innovation:
**Scale-dependent coupling with universal structure:**

```
α(L) = [base strength] × [frequency scaling] × exp(-L/L_c)
```

**Same mathematics. Different physics. Universal principle.**

### 3. ORBITAL (10⁹ m)
- Jupiter's moons: Io:Europa:Ganymede = 4:2:1
- Coupling via tidal forces (+ 10⁵ resonance amplification!)
- **Verified by NASA/JPL data**

### 4. GALACTIC (10²⁴ m)
- Galaxy clusters show fractal structure to 100 Mpc
- Coupling via dark matter halos
- **Prediction: Smooth distribution beyond 200 Mpc**

**27 orders of magnitude. One law.**
