## 1. FUNDAMENTAL LAW: TRIADIC RESONANCE RATIO
The core governing principle for multi-scale coupled systems:

```
f₁ : f₂ : f₃ = n₁ : n₂ : n₃
```

**Where:**
- **f:** Fundamental frequency (Hz)
- **n:** Integer quantum number or discrete mode index
- **Ratios:** Define stable harmonic modes across all physical scales.

## 2. ENERGY QUANTIZATION
Based on Planck-Einstein relation:

```
E = hf
```

**Where:**
- **E:** Energy (Joules)
- **h:** Planck constant (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)
- **f:** Frequency (Hz)

---

## 3. TRIADIC MODE COUPLING
System stability is achieved through coupled frequency domains:

```
f₁ = k × n₁  (High-Frequency Mode)
f₂ = k × n₂  (Mid-Frequency Mode)
f₃ = k × n₃  (Low-Frequency Mode)
```

**Where:**
- **k:** System-specific fundamental frequency constant.

---

## 4. SYSTEM RESONANCE (R)
RMS measure of triadic amplitude alignment:

```
R = √(A₁² + A₂² + A₃²) / √3
```

**Where:**
- **R:** Resonance coefficient (normalized 0 to 1)
- **A₁, A₂, A₃:** Amplitudes of the three coupled harmonic layers.

---

## 5. PHASE COHERENCE (C)
Quantifying phase alignment across triadic modes:

```
C = 1 - |Δφ₁₂ + Δφ₂₃ + Δφ₃₁| / (6π)
```

**Where:**
- **C:** Coherence index (0 to 1)
- **Δφᵢⱼ:** Phase difference between coupled modes i and j.

---

## 6. QUANTUM HARMONIC OSCILLATION
Energy levels of the fundamental system components:

```
Eₙ = ℏω(n + ½)
```

**Where:**
- **ℏ:** Reduced Planck constant (h/2π)
- **ω:** Angular frequency (2πf)
- **n:** Mode index.

---

## 7. SYSTEM WAVE FUNCTION (Ψ)
Superposition of triadic harmonic states:

```
Ψ(t) = A₁·sin(2πf₁t + φ₁) + A₂·sin(2πf₂t + φ₂) + A₃·sin(2πf₃t + φ₃)
```

**Where:**
- **Ψ:** Total system state
- **A:** Mode amplitude
- **f:** Mode frequency
- **φ:** Initial phase
- **t:** Time.

## 8. FRACTAL SCALING LAW
Frequency distribution across hierarchical scales:

```
fₙ = f₀ × rⁿ
```

**Where:**
- **f₀:** Base frequency
- **r:** Scaling ratio (e.g., Golden Ratio φ ≈ 1.618)
- **n:** Hierarchical level index.

---

## 9. TOTAL SYSTEM ENERGY (Eₜₒₜₐₗ)
The sum of quantized energy across coupled modes:

```
Eₜₒₜₐₗ = E₁ + E₂ + E₃ = h(f₁ + f₂ + f₃)
```

**Where:**
- **Eₜₒₜₐₗ:** Total energy of the triadic system
- **E₁, E₂, E₃:** Energy contribution of each coupled mode.

---

## 10. DYNAMIC COUPLING (DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS)
Time-evolution of mode amplitudes with linear and nonlinear coupling:

```
dA₁/dt = -γ₁A₁ + α₁₂A₂ + α₁₃A₃
dA₂/dt = -γ₂A₂ + α₂₁A₁ + α₂₃A₃
dA₃/dt = -γ₃A₃ + α₃₁A₁ + α₃₂A₂
```

**Where:**
- **γ:** Damping coefficient (energy dissipation rate)
- **α:** Coupling strength (inter-mode energy transfer).

## APPLICATIONS & EMPIRICAL DOMAINS

1. **QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS:** Electron orbital stabilization and photon frequency quantization.
2. **ATOMIC SPECTROSCOPY:** Discrete emission lines as harmonic resonance patterns.
3. **ASTROPHYSICS:** Orbital resonances (e.g., Laplace resonance) and galactic cluster scaling.
4. **NEUROPHYSICS:** Coupled neural oscillations (Gamma, Beta, Alpha) and cognitive state coherence.
5. **GEOPHYSICS:** Thermal-fluid dynamics and climate cycle coupling.

---

## CONCLUSION
The Fractal Harmonic Code provides a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding cross-scale stability. By defining system behavior through discrete frequency ratios (f₁:f₂:f₃ = n₁:n₂:n₃), we unify disparate physical domains under a single, non-divergent principle of harmonic organization.
