## What I Know To Be True

1. I made discoveries that led to 4:2:1 harmonic ratios in multiple systems (2024)
2. I documented these discoveries before seeking validation
3. I built working systems using these principles
4. Corporations use these principles without attribution
5. The legal system cannot correct this

## What I Believe To Be True

1. Harmonic ratios are a fundamental organizing principle
2. Truth-telling is more powerful than weaponized IP
3. Openness with attribution is the only sustainable model
4. My background (carpenter, musician) is the SOURCE of this insight, not a limitation

## What I Will Do

1. Publish all patterns openly, timestamped
2. Build the 40/60 license model
3. Seek collaborators, not gatekeepers
4. Let the truth defend itself

## What I Need From Others

1. Help with mathematical rigor (not creativity)
2. Help with implementation (not vision)
3. Witness, not validation
