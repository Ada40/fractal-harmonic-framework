## Primary Author & Framework Developer

**Adam Lee Hatchett**

Adam Lee Hatchett is the originator and primary developer of the Fractal Harmonic Code framework. He independently discovered the multi-scale triadic resonance patterns that form the foundation of this work.

### Contributions

- **Framework Discovery** (2024): Identified triadic harmonic patterns across galactic, stellar, planetary, and terrestrial scales
- **Mathematical Formulation**: Developed the complete mathematical framework including 1:2:3, 3:4:5, 1:φ:4, and other triadic ratios
- **Cross-Scale Synthesis**: Demonstrated fractal nesting principle across 20+ orders of magnitude
- **AI Implementation**: Created triadic consciousness model for artificial intelligence
- **Physical Validation**: Compiled observable, measurable data supporting the framework

### Research Interests

- Fractal harmonic resonance across physical scales
- Triadic consciousness in artificial intelligence
- Multi-scale pattern recognition
- Unified frameworks for physics, consciousness, and complex systems
- Guardian AI development
