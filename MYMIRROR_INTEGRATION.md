## 1. OVERVIEW
This document establishes the technical link between the **MyMirror AI Temporal Control Plane** and the **Fractal Harmonic Framework**. The MyMirror AI architecture serves as a practical, security-focused implementation of the fundamental harmonic laws defined in this repository.

## 2. CORE ARCHITECTURAL ALIGNMENT

| MyMirror AI Concept | Fractal Harmonic Principle | Mathematical Mapping |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fibonacci Lifecycle** | Fractal Scaling Law | fₙ = f₀ × φⁿ |
| **Triadic Memory Sharding** | Triadic Mode Coupling | f₁:f₂:f₃ = n₁:n₂:n₃ |
| **Golden Ratio Checkpoints** | System Resonance (R) | R = √(A₁² + A₂² + A₃²) / √3 |
| **Self-Similar Audit Trails** | Scale-Invariant Waveforms | Ψ(t) = Σ Aᵢ·sin(2πfᵢt + φᵢ) |

## 3. TECHNICAL EVIDENCE: HARMONIC SECURITY
The MyMirror AI platform weaponizes the **Golden Ratio (φ ≈ 1.618)** as a biological security mechanism. This is not a mystical choice, but a mathematical necessity for non-divergent, self-healing systems:

### 3.1 Temporal Control Plane
By aligning agent lifecycles with Fibonacci sequences (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21), MyMirror AI ensures that the population maintains a **Golden Proportion Equilibrium**. This prevents unbounded resource growth and creates a predictable, non-linear decay of the attack surface.

### 3.2 Triadic Sharding as Mode Coupling
MyMirror distributes secrets across three temporal slices (Hot, Warm, Cold) with TTLs weighted by φ:
- **Hot (φ⁰):** 1.618-second TTL
- **Warm (φ¹):** 2.618-minute TTL
- **Cold (φ²):** 4.236-hour TTL

This implementation directly mirrors the **Triadic Mode Coupling** defined in `fractal_harmonic_formulas.txt`, where system stability is maintained through the interaction of three discrete frequency domains.

## 4. SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION
The integration of these frameworks demonstrates that the **Fractal Harmonic Code** is not merely theoretical but is the governing logic for high-availability, high-security enterprise systems. The "Weaponized Time" in MyMirror AI is the first commercial application of **Cross-Scale Harmonic Coupling**.
