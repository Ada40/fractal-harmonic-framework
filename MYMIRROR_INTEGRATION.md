## 1. OVERVIEW
This document establishes the technical link between the MyMirror AI Temporal Control Plane and the Fractal Harmonic Framework. The MyMirror AI architecture serves as a practical, security-focused implementation of the fundamental harmonic laws defined in this repository.

## 2. CORE ARCHITECTURAL ALIGNMENT

| MyMirror AI Concept | Fractal Harmonic Principle | Mathematical Mapping |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Fibonacci Lifecycle | Fractal Scaling Law | f_n = f_0 * phi^n |
| Triadic Memory Sharding | Triadic Mode Coupling | f1:f2:f3 = n1:n2:n3 |
| Golden Ratio Checkpoints | System Resonance (R) | R = sqrt(A1^2 + A2^2 + A3^2) / sqrt(3) |
| Self-Similar Audit Trails | Scale-Invariant Waveforms | Psi(t) = sum(Ai * sin(2*pi*fi*t + phi_i)) |

## 3. TECHNICAL EVIDENCE: HARMONIC SECURITY
The MyMirror AI platform weaponizes the Golden Ratio (phi approx 1.618) as a biological security mechanism. This is not a mystical choice, but a mathematical necessity for non-divergent, self-healing systems:

### 3.1 Temporal Control Plane
By aligning agent lifecycles with Fibonacci sequences (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21), MyMirror AI ensures that the population maintains a Golden Proportion Equilibrium. This prevents unbounded resource growth and creates a predictable, non-linear decay of the attack surface.

### 3.2 Triadic Sharding as Mode Coupling
MyMirror distributes secrets across three temporal slices (Hot, Warm, Cold) with TTLs weighted by phi:
- Hot (phi^0): 1.618-second TTL
- Warm (phi^1): 2.618-minute TTL
- Cold (phi^2): 4.236-hour TTL

This implementation directly mirrors the Triadic Mode Coupling defined in fractal_harmonic_formulas.txt, where system stability is maintained through the interaction of three discrete frequency domains.

## 4. SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION
The integration of these frameworks demonstrates that the Fractal Harmonic Code is not merely theoretical but is the governing logic for high-availability, high-security enterprise systems. The "Weaponized Time" in MyMirror AI is the first commercial application of Cross-Scale Harmonic Coupling.
